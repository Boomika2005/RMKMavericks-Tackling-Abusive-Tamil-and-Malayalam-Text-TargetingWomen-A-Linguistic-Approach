Overview:

This study addresses the challenge of detecting abusive language targeting women on social media in Tamil and Malayalam. Due to the lack of robust tools for these regional languages, we employ machine learning techniques to develop classification models for abusive content detection.

Dataset:

* Tamil: An external dataset was used to enhance training.
* Malayalam: The provided dataset was used without additional external data.
* Data Processing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization were applied to structure the data.

Methodology:

* Tamil: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with TF-IDF feature extraction.
* Malayalam: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) with TF-IDF feature extraction.
* Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
